# dnn Compiler

## 📛 Introduction 

dnn Compiler is designed to **enable and perform** deep learning neural networks trainined on variery of frameworks (like TensorFlow, PyTorch etc) by focussing on features of custom ai-accelerators like FPGAs, eFPGAs and other embedded devices like risc-V, raspberry-pi and others.

dnn Compiler is based on [LLVM compiler tool chain](https://llvm.org/) specialized for deep neural networks with [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) as front end.

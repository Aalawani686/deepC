# dnn Compiler
---

## 📛 Introduction 

dnn Compiler is designed to **enable and perform** deep learning neural networks by focussing on features of custom ai-accelerators like FPGAs, eFPGAs and other embedded devices like risc-V, raspberry-pi and others.

dnn Compiler is based on [LLVM compiler tool chain](https://llvm.org/) and [openAcc](https://www.openacc.org/) specialized for deep neural networks with [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) as front end.

## ⚙ Installation
build and install dnn Compiler locally from source code with following steps

```
git clone https://github.com/ai-techsystems/dnnCompiler
cd dnnc
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## ➕ Contribute

dnn Compiler adopts apache committer model, we aim to create an open source project that is maintained and owned by the community. Checkout the Contributor Guide.

## 🙏 Acknowledgement 
We acknowledge the efforts predecessor projects like [LLVM](https://llvm.org/), [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) etc. to make this project a reality.

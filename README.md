# dnn Compiler

## Introduction

dnn Compiler is designed to **enable and perform** deep learning neural networks trainined on variery of frameworks (like TensorFlow, PyTorch etc) by focussing on features of custom ai-accelerators like FPGAs, eFPGAs and other embedded devices like risc-V, raspberry-pi and others.

dnn Compiler is based on LLVM compiler tool chain specialized for deep neural networks with [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) as front end.

## Contribute to dnn Compiler

dnn Compiler adopts apache committer model, we aim to create an open source project that is maintained and owned by the community. Checkout the Contributor Guide.

## Acknowledgement
We aim to learnt from other enabling projects like LLVM, ONNX etc.
